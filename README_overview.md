The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis of locations that are lacking critical resources. The non-profit organization that we are proposing would be founded and organized to improve the quality of life for people in the affected areas.<br><br>
The means of analysis will include data analysis in the following areas.The intention of this project is to search for and use data that is broken down by county or zip code for the USA or areas of the USA. Some of the data sources that will be used in this analysis are:<br><br>
<li>Median age </li><br><ul><li>[County Population Totals: 2010-2019](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html#par_textimage_242301767)
County Population Totals: 2010-2019</li></ul><br>
<li>Cost of Housing</li><br><ul><li>[Quandl API for Housing Data](https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-housing-data)!</li></ul><br>
<li>Per Capita income</li><br>
<ul>[personal income](https://www.bea.gov/data/income-saving/personal-income-county-metro-and-other-areas)</li></ul>
<li>Educational results</li>
</ul><br><ul>[EDFacts Data Files](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/data-files/index.html)</li></ul><br>

The group has collected data from the above resources. A multiple step process has been discussed and implemented to clean the data and format the data to establish common data reference points to achieve the desired end goal. The group has decided to break the data down by counties in Texas. The initial asumption is that this data will correlate and identify areas or neighborhoods that are in need of non-profit organiztions that can help in life situations.
